### **H**

**Hash Function**  
Deterministic one-way function producing fixed-length digest from arbitrary-length input[1][5].

**HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)**  
Integrity and authenticity check combining a secret key with a hash function[1].

**Hybrid Encryption**  
Combines asymmetric encryption for key exchange with symmetric encryption for data[1].

**IV (Initialization Vector)**  
Nonce used in block cipher modes to ensure unique ciphertext for identical plaintext blocks[1][5].

**Key**  
Secret value used by cryptographic algorithms for encryption/decryption or signing/verifying[1][5].

**Keyspace**  
Set of all possible keys for a given cipher[1][3].

**Kerckhoffs' Principle**  
Security should depend solely on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm[1].

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**  
Framework of CAs, RAs, certificates, and revocation mechanisms managing asymmetric keys[1][5].

Secret key in asymmetric cryptography used for decryption or signing[1][5].

**Public Key**  
Non-secret key in asymmetric cryptography used for encryption or signature verification[1][5].

### **R**

**Rail Fence Cipher**  
Transposition cipher writing plaintext in zig-zag on multiple rails and reading row-by-row[1].

**RSA**  
Asymmetric algorithm based on prime factorization; widely used for encryption and digital signatures[1].

Attack scenario where the adversary has full knowledge of both algorithm and implementation details[1].

### **Z**

**Zero-Knowledge Proof**  
Protocol by which one party proves knowledge of a secret to another without revealing the secret itself[1].
